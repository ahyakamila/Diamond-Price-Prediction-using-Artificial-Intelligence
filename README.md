# Diamond-Price-Prediction-using-Artificial-Intelligence
Diamonds are gemstones that have a high price due to scarcity and the process of getting them is not easy. This stone is also widely liked because it can be used as investment and jewelry because of its beautiful shape. Diamonds have varying prices depending on various factors. This is what drives the diamond price prediction. Here, the prediction of diamond prices is carried out using machine learning by comparing 3 algorithms, namely the K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor, Decission Tree, and MLP Regressor. These algorithms are compared to find out which one produces the best accuracy in predicting diamond prices.
